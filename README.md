# Acalanes-Attendance
Automatic attendance taker for Acalanes Union High School District I wrote while I was a student there. Its a Flask app that compares participant data from Zoom API to roster in postgreSQL database and outputs names of tardy or absent students to custom website that can be found [here](https://acalanesattendance.herokuapp.com/). Hosted on a free Heroku server.
